Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation of ProxTorch!

ProxTorch is a state-of-the-art library that furnishes an array of proximal operators and constraints, pivotal components in the world of optimization, especially for challenges infused with non-smooth regularization terms or specific constraints.

**What are Proximal Operators and Constraints?**
-------------------------------------------------

Mathematically, for a convex function \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{ +\infty \} \), the proximal operator of \( f \) is articulated as:

\[ \text{prox}_f(v) = \arg \min_x \left\{ f(x) + \frac{1}{2} \| x - v \|_2^2 \right\} \]

Simplistically, the proximal operator is a mechanism that ingests an input vector \( v \) and returns a vector that edges closer to the minimizer of \( f \). This operator adeptly "nudges" \( v \) towards zones where \( f \) dwindles.

Constraints, on the other hand, define feasible sets or boundaries within which solutions must reside. They can either be hard constraints, ensuring solutions never breach the set boundaries, or soft constraints, incurring penalties for violations.

**How Do Proximal Operators and Constraints Bolster Gradient Descent?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gradient Descent, a renowned iterative technique, primarily zeroes in on the local minimum of a differentiable scalar function. It iteratively steps towards the direction signaling the steepest function descent.

However, the territory gets treacherous with non-smooth functions or problems laden with constraints. This is where proximal operators and constraints shine. Coupling gradient descent with proximal methodologies gives birth to the Proximal Gradient Descent algorithm. This potent blend taps into gradient cues and problem structures (via proximal operators and constraints) to guarantee convergence and craft solutions that toe the line with constraints or non-smooth patterns.

In essence, while gradient descent chalks out the direction, proximal operators and constraints ensure this trajectory respects the intrinsic problem framework.

**Why ProxTorch on PyTorch?**
------------------------------

PyTorch, a frontrunner in the gradient-optimization realm of deep learning, often grapples with the blurring lines between quintessential optimization predicaments and deep learning nuances. This necessitates more intricate optimization arsenals within the PyTorch sphere.

Enter ProxTorch. With it, both researchers and aficionados can meld advanced optimization stratagems into their PyTorch-driven machine learning blueprints. Whether it's deciphering a classic convex optimization riddle, nurturing a neural network with bespoke regularizers, or straddling anything in between, ProxTorch is your go-to toolkit, drenched in the comfort and adaptability of PyTorch.
